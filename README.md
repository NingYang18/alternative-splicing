Source code for any specialized, in-house scripts that are used for this paper are in the source code folder.

1,for_unique-RNAseq.pl was used to filter uniquely mapped reads from RNA-seq data.

2,for_unique-ATAC.pl was used to remove the redundant reads from ATAC-seq data.

3,for_overlap_bed.py was used to find the overlap region between two bed input file (an overlap of at least 1 nt between the two bed region was considered as overlap region).
